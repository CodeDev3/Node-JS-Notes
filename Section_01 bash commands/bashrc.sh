# ðŸ§© What .bashrc Is

# .bashrc (short for Bash Run Commands) is a hidden configuration file that runs automatically 
# every time you start a new terminal session in an interactive shell (like when you open a new 
# terminal tab in macOS or Linux).

# Itâ€™s typically located in your home directory:
# ~/.bashrc

# You can use .bashrc to:

# Set environment variables

# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
# export EDITOR=nano


# Create command aliases

# alias ll='ls -la'
# alias gs='git status'


# Customize your prompt (PS1)

# PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ '


# Automatically start background processes or scripts.
